The setup.exe is compressed in rar because github does not allow uploading files larger than 25mb and the file is 28mb, sorry for the inconvenience. Finnaly i upload to mega.nz
To start the builder.py you need to run the "setup.py" first to install the requirements, 
if they are not installed then start the "setup.exe" which is inside the rar file as it is better programmed to install all the requirements, 
if it doesn't work, use pip3 install -r requirements .txt in "visual code,
you should install python3 first, the latter is recommended, 
when you install it you should copy the address of python.exe,
the pip that is in the scripts folder for vs to detect pip you need to go to system and environment variables,
go to environment variables section and go to system variables section below and in path and select "new" and add where they are the pythons.exe and the scripts folder, 
all of that if the install doesn't select will be added to the path so you can see it at the beginning of the python install or else if pip doesn't catch it after adding it. 
Finally, it would be to put pip in the vs terminal and see if it gives you the cheat sheet, 
after all that, the previous command so that all the requirements are installed. 
Thank you for using the tool,,,, MAXIMUM SUPPORT!!
